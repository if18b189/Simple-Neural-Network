# Simple-Neural-Network

## Overview
[philtabor](https://github.com/philtabor) made a great tutorial on neural networks. I rewrote the entire code and added some personal notes while watching the tutorial.
In this fork of [Simple-Neural-Network](https://github.com/philtabor/Simple-Neural-Network) I plan on adding some superficial functionalities, such as a GUI and a saving and loading function for the trained models.

Since I rewrote the entire project from scratch, some lines might differ from the original project.

## Roadmap:
- [ ] save function, to save trained models
- [ ] load function, to load saved models
- [ ] draw your own numbers and check if model is able to identify, make it more interactive
- [ ] add GUI?

### original README.md by [philtabor](https://github.com/philtabor)

This is my procedural implementation of a simple neural network to classify the MNIST image data set.

Please download the data from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Even with this naive implementation, we can get 95% and above accuracy. Of course more
complicated algorithms result in higher accuracy, but for a simplistic model this works reasonably well.
